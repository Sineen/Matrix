choose to save the matrix in one vector where the order of the values
is the order or reading a matrix and to get where each row adn column ends
we have column and row values and size which is row * column
with the help of row and column i could know which values in my vector is
correspondent to which row or column


1) obviously there is a difference where Eigen is much faster than my solution
	Eigen has a faster access to its data thus making it more efficient
	since the layout we used for Eigen saves the matrix in columns it gives it easier faster access
	when we do multiplication between matrix my solution would have tol calculate the columns
	over and over again with each row while Eigen solution doesnt need to do that.

2) as we see the sum is faster than the multiplication in both.
	this is due to having to go over the two matrices once in the sum,
	once we are done with a cell we do not go back to it while it is not as linear for multiplication
	where each row is multiplied by each column of the second matrix and summed up
	thus having to go over each value multiple times
